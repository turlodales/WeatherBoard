This is my own attempted to get reworking my layout is taken form another tweak i have been working so i will be neating this up later just trying to make it looking better for my own mind

why am i putting is on github:

for one resaon only extra backup i have the project on my mac mini, my own freenas server, and github so if any one of them gets cruppted i have backup saved.

Notes:

I would like to say a big thank you to the people that have helped me make this happen:

Allan Kerr the person that makes this tweak in the first place

more to follow if I get help

myself to prove that even someone like me with dyslexia can do something to help the jailbreaking community

FreeNAS OS for my Home Server's

Youtube for the vid's that have helped me do this I will list them all soon more to follow when I have spoken to them if I can post they vids

In case anyone is wondering I started using jailbroken devices from the iPhone original 2G,3GS,4S,5S,6S+,8+ I do like the S models. I only have 2 iPads Air 2 and Pro 12.9. I have the Apple TV 3 and 4 sadly both not jailbroken yet and I have the Apple Watch 1st gen. I now have the 5C I got of eBay on 10.3.3 sadly I don't have any of the SHSH2 blobs saved I just want to help put something back into the community.
